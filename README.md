# Udacity Front-End Nanodegree - Project Feed Reader Testing

This is a Udacity project that was used to train in JavaScript testing. For this purpose the JavaScript testing framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was used. The Feed Reader app itself was given, only the test suites in the 'feedreader.js'-file (in jasmine/spec/..) were written by me. Overall 7 test were created that test if the RSS Feeds are defined, the slide menu works properly (opens and closes), whether initial entries are actually there when app starts and if changes in content happen if user picks another feed.

## How to run the application

Simply clone the repo and start the app by opening index.html in your browser. Jasmine will run the test defined in 'feedreader.js' and show the results at the bottom of the index.html page. If everything is green (dots, text) and Jasmine indicates "7 specs, 0 failures", then all test have been successful.
